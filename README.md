**Roads** is is a free software *Roblox* concurrency library.

## Usage
Roads uses [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) as a bridge between the filesystem and
Roblox Studio. If you want to contribute or use Roads for development, install
both to get started. The project contains a `default.project.json` that can be
used by Rojo to generate or sync with a Roblox save file.

## Documentation
The only documentation is currently in the source. This will be changing soon.

## Contributing
